Rally is basic reliable chat implementation written in python.  Its mission is to provide reliable communication on
unreliable connections.  It uses a curses based ui and works on 
unix / linux.  It features extensive use of fancy python decorators, just for fun.

Usage:
as a client:
python client.py [server] [port]

By default it will hit my instance of the server which may or may not be up [but probably is at any given time]

To start your own server:

python server.py [port]

By default, rally operates on port 5959.
Communications are not encrpyted.  They are just pickled python objects.
